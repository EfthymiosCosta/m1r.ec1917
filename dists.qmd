## What is a distance?

**Definition (Distance Function/Metric):** A distance function, also known as a metric, is a function $d: M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a set, satisfying the following:

1.  $d(x, y) \geq 0 \forall x, y \in M$ (Non-negativity),
2.  $d(x,y) = d(y, x) \forall x,y \in M$ (Symmetry),
3.  $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$ (Indiscernibles),
4.  $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z) \forall x,y,z \in M$ (Triangle inequality)

## The Euclidean distance

**Definition (Euclidean distance on** $\mathbb{R}^d$): The Euclidean distance between two points $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is defined as follows: $$
d_E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \| = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{j=1}^d (x_j - y_j)^2}.
$$ The Euclidean distance is one of the most basic and most useful distance functions that you are probably already familiar with. It can be calculated in any finite dimension $p$ and has a very intuitive interpretation as the length of the line segment between any two observations.

**Example:** The Euclidean distance on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a valid distance function. Let's prove this:

**1. Non-negativity:**

Since $(x_j - y_j)^2 \geq 0$ for all $j$, we have $\sum_{j=1}^d (x_j - y_j)^2 \geq 0$. Taking the square root preserves non-negativity, so $d_E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^d (x_j - y_j)^2} \geq 0$.

**2. Symmetry:**

$$d_E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^d (x_j - y_j)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^d (y_j - x_j)^2} = d_E(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x}),$$

since $(x_j - y_j)^2 = (y_j - x_j)^2$.

**3. Identity of indiscernibles:**

$(\Rightarrow)$ If $d_E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = 0$, then $\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^d (x_j - y_j)^2} = 0$, which implies $\sum_{j=1}^d (x_j - y_j)^2 = 0$. Since each term $(x_j - y_j)^2 \geq 0$ and their sum is zero, we must have $(x_j - y_j)^2 = 0$ for all $j$, therefore $x_j = y_j \forall j \in \{1, \ldots, d\}$, so $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}$.

$(\Leftarrow)$ If $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}$, then $x_j = y_j$ for all $j$, so $d_E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^d 0^2} = 0$.

**4. Triangle inequality:**

We need to show $d_E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) \leq d_E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) + d_E(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z})$, or equivalently: $$\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}\| \leq \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| + \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{z}\|.$$

Note that $\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z} = (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}) + (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{z})$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and properties of norms in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we have: $$\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}\| = \|(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}) + (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{z})\| \leq \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| + \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{z}\|.$$

This is the standard triangle inequality for the Euclidean norm. $\square$

## The Manhattan distance

**Definition (Manhattan distance on** $\mathbb{R}^d$): The Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab, city block, or rectilinear distance) between two points $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is defined as follows: $$
d_T(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \|_T = \sum\limits_{j=1}^d \lvert x_j - y_j\rvert.
$$ The Manhattan distance makes use of the so-called *Manhattan geometry*, where the distance between any two points is defined as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.

::: funfact-box
💡 **Fun fact**

The reason it's called the "Manhattan", "taxicab", or "city block" distance is because of the famous borough of Manhattan in New York City, which is planned with a rectangular grid of streets, meaning that a taxicab can only travel along grid directions.

## The Minkowski distance

**Definition (Minkowski distance on** $\mathbb{R}^d$): The Minkowski distance between two points $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is defined as follows: $$
d_M(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \|_M = \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^d \lvert x_j - y_j\rvert^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}, \quad p \geq 1.
$$ You can see that the Minkowski distance is the Manhattan distance for $p=1$ and the Euclidean distance for $p=2$. The Minkowski distance is a generalisation of both!

::: funfact-box
💡 **Fun fact**

When $p \rightarrow \infty$, the Minkowski distance becomes equivalent to: $$
\lim\limits_{p \rightarrow \infty} \left( \sum\limits_{j=1}^d \lvert x_j - y_j \rvert^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} = \max\limits_{1 \leq j \leq d} \lvert x_j - y_j \rvert,
$$ which is known as the *Chebyshev distance*; can you prove this result?
:::

The Figure below displays the "unit circles" for the Minkowski distance with varying $p$. Notice that $p = 0.5$ is also included; this does not define a proper distance function.

## Dissimilarities vs. Distances

**Definition (Dissimilarity Function):** A dissimilarity is a function $d: M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a set, satisfying the following:

1.  $d(x, y) \geq 0 \forall x, y \in M$ (Non-negativity),
2.  $d(x,y) = d(y, x) \forall x,y \in M$ (Symmetry),
3.  $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$ (Indiscernibles)

A dissimilarity function relaxes the requirement for the triangle inequality to hold. This is precisely what distinguishes a dissimilarity from a distance function. Therefore, **all distance functions are valid dissimilarity functions**. However, the opposite direction is not always true!

**Example:** The Minkowski function with $p=0.5$ is a dissimilarity function but not a distance function.

Let's prove this together; firstly, we note that the 3 shared conditions (non-negativity, symmetry, indiscernibles) are trivially true. We only need to check for the triangle inequality.

Let us take $\mathbf{x} = (0, 0)^\top$, $\mathbf{y} = (1, 1)^\top$ and $\mathbf{z} = (0, 1)^\top$. Then: $$
\begin{align}
d_M(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^d \lvert x_j - y_j\rvert^\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} = (1 + 1)^2 = 4,\\
d_M(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^d \lvert x_j - y_j\rvert^\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} = (0 + 1)^2 = 1,\\
d_M(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z}) = \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^d \lvert x_j - y_j\rvert^\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} = (0 + 1)^2 = 1.
\end{align}
$$ Therefore, $d_M(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) > d_M(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) + d_M(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z})$, which means that the triangle inequality does not hold. Therefore, the Minkowski distance with $p = 0.5$ is a dissimilarity but not a distance function. $\square$

::: funfact-box
💡 **Fun fact**

The Minkowski function with $0 < p < 1$ is a dissimilarity function but not a proper metric *(can you prove this?)*, whereas for $p \geq 1$, it is a distance function.

## 🤔 Quiz: Some of the following functions are valid distance functions, while others are dissimilarities but not distances. Which of these are distance functions?

## Similarities

**Definition (Similarity Function):** Given a dissimilarity function $d: M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, a similarity function is a defined as $s : M \times M \rightarrow [0, 1]$ with $s(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = f(d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}))$, where $f:[0, \infty) \rightarrow [0, 1]$ is a decreasing function with $f(0) = 1$ and $\lim\limits_{t \rightarrow \infty} f(t) = 0$.

**Example:** Let $f(t) = \exp\left( - \frac{t^2}{2\gamma^2} \right)$ for $\gamma > 0$. The following function is a valid similarity: $$
s(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = f(d_E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})) = \exp\left\{ - \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^d (x_j - y_j)^2}{2\gamma^2} \right\}, \gamma > 0, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d.
$$ This is also known as the **Gaussian kernel** or **Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel** *(you do not need to know what a kernel is at this point, but it is a very useful concept in machine learning)*.

Other options for $f$ include:

1.  $f(t) = \exp(-t)$
2.  $f(t) = \frac{1}{1 + t}$
3.  $f(t) = \frac{1}{1 + t^2}$
4.  $f(t) = \max \left(0, 1 - \frac{t}{\tau}\right), \ \tau > 0$
5.  $f(t) = 1- \frac{2}{\pi}\arctan (\alpha t), \ \alpha > 0$

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}

\end{cases}
$$

## Computing distances in `R`

The `dist` function provides an easy and quick way of computing distances (or dissimilarities) in `R`.
The output is a distance/dissimilarity matrix, which you can also visualise! Below is a
toy example with 50 randomly generated 2-dimensional vectors, where each component is drawn from a standard Uniform distribution.

```{r}
# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate 50 2D random vectors = 100 standard uniform values
# Store in a 50 x 2 matrix
X <- matrix(data = runif(n = 100, min = 0, max = 1),
            nrow = 50,
            ncol = 2)

dist_mat <- dist(x = X, method = "euclidean")
dist_matrix <- as.matrix(dist_mat, nrow = nrow(X), ncol = ncol(X))

# Create layout with space for legend
layout(matrix(c(1, 2), nrow = 1), widths = c(4, 1))

# Adjust margins for main plot (bottom, left, top, right)
par(mar = c(5, 5, 4, 1))

# Main plot with custom palette
n_colors <- 256
colors <- hcl.colors(n_colors, palette = "YlOrRd")

image(x = 1:nrow(dist_matrix),
      y = 1:ncol(dist_matrix),
      z = dist_matrix,
      col = colors,
      xlab = "Observation",
      ylab = "Observation",
      main = "Euclidean Distance Matrix",
      axes = FALSE)
axis(1, at = seq(1, 50, by = 5))
axis(2, at = seq(1, 50, by = 5), las = 1)
box()

# Color bar legend with matching colors
par(mar = c(5, 1, 4, 4))
legend_values <- seq(min(dist_matrix), max(dist_matrix), length.out = n_colors)
image(x = 1, 
      y = legend_values, 
      z = matrix(legend_values, nrow = 1),
      col = colors, 
      axes = FALSE, 
      xlab = "", 
      ylab = "")
axis(4, las = 1)
mtext("Distance", side = 4, line = 2.5)
```
The `image` function produces a heat map but notice how it requires an argument of class `matrix`.
Therefore, we make sure to convert our distance matrix object to a `matrix` object and specify
the number of rows and columns, which has to be equal to $n$.

::: funfact-box
💡 **Fun fact**

The `dist` function supports several distance metrics. Explore its documentation by typing
`?dist` on the console and see what other distance functions can be implemented, besides the Euclidean.
How would you compute the dissimilarity matrix for a dissimilarity function that is not included in
the documentation?
:::

::: {.practice-box}
🚀 **Time to practice!**

Generate some synthetic data (e.g. by sampling from a uniform or a Normal distribution) and
use the `dist` function with any distance function of your choice. Repeat this process but
keep increasing the number of dimensions. What do you observe?

*(Hint: Use the `image` function to visualise the distance matrix each time)*.

## Key takeaways

-   Clustering algorithms use distances, dissimilarities, or similarities to assign objects into groups.
-   Points with low pairwise distances/dissimilarities are commonly assigned in the same cluster, whereas highly distant/dissimilar points are in distinct clusters.
-   All distances are dissimilarities but not the other way round.
-   The triangle inequality is what makes a dissimilarity function a proper distance function.
-   Large distance/dissimilarity $\implies$ low similarity, while low distance/dissimilarity $\implies$ high similarity.
-   The `dist` function in `R` can be used for computing a distance matrix.
